# Google Stock Price Prediction

## Project Description
In this project, it is aimed that predicting stock price for a company and Google is selected to be the subject company of this project. In order to obtain data, Yahoo Finance API is used and the obtained data is between *August 19, 2004* and *December 1, 2023*. If you would like to see content of the dataset, you can check out the dataset in the **Google_Stock_Price_Dataset.csv** file. In order to accomplish prediction operation, following **Regression ML Algorithms** are used, **Linear Regression**, **K-Nearest Neighbors Regression**, **Random Forest Regression**, **Decision Tree Regression**, **Ridge Regression** and **Gaussian Regression**. These ML Algorithms are evaluated by using **R_Squared** and **Mean Squared Error** metrics. As a result of these algorithms, best performed models are *Linear Regression* and *Gaussian Regression* algorithms although all other algorithms performed quite well. According to evaluation results, Linearity Assumptions are checked in order to interpret because one of the best performing models is Linear Regression. It should be mentioned that, Data Science Project LifeCycle is followed on this project to effectively simulate business level project handling as it can be seen from the following image. Therefore, project is formed in to 7 steps with the proceduralized contents and the step/file names are as follow; **1. Business_Understanding**, **2. Data_Mining**, **3. Data_Cleaning**, **4. Data_Exploration_(EDA)**, **5. Feature_Engineering**, **6.  Predictive_Modelling_&_Evaluation** and **7. Data_Visualization**.
